---

## 📖 Chapter 1: Introduction (New content)

- [ ] Merge background from all three paper intros
- [ ] Describe biological & modeling motivation for studying ion–lipid interactions
- [ ] Outline problems with force field mixing rules (LB, non-polarizable)
- [ ] Introduce MB–NB-fix method and ParOpt rationale
- [ ] Present dissertation objectives (bullet or paragraph form)
- [ ] Explain terminology (steric/imperfect/perfect adsorption, hydration boundary)
- [ ] Provide a map of the chapters and their logical progression
- [ ] Cite key prior literature for background

---

## 📄 Chapter 2: Na⁺ Parameterization (Langmuir 2022)

- [x] Include published content (as-is or with minor formatting edits)
- [ ] Ensure all figures/tables are numbered correctly
- [ ] Add brief preamble if needed to situate chapter within dissertation

---

## 📄 Chapter 3: Adsorption Modes of Na⁺, Li⁺, Mg²⁺ (Langmuir 2024)

- [x] Include published content
- [ ] Remove intro content now folded into Chapter 1
- [ ] Ensure consistent terminology for adsorption modes
- [ ] Add brief preamble if desired

---

## 📄 Chapter 4: Alteration of Bilayer Structure by Adsorbed Mg²⁺

- [x] Include draft content
- [ ] Clean up any placeholders, finalize all figure references
- [ ] Include parameter descriptions for 2024 vs 2025 Mg²⁺ models
- [ ] Ensure hydration boundary and water order parameter descriptions are complete

---

## 📘 Chapter 5: General Conclusions and Future Work (New content)

- [ ] Summarize key insights from Chapters 2–4
- [ ] Reiterate how MB–NB-fix addresses force field mixing issues
- [ ] Discuss broader impact on MD modeling of biological membranes
- [ ] Reflect on limitations (non-polarizable models, no Cl⁻ optimization yet)
- [ ] Propose future work (Cl⁻, proteins, polarization, multiscale modeling)

---

## 📎 Appendices (as needed)

- [ ] LJ parameter tables (final optimized values)
- [ ] Nelder-Mead constraints (Table S3)
- [ ] Sample cluster structures and energies
- [ ] ParOpt configuration / usage notes
- [ ] Custom analysis scripts or repo link

---

## 📚 References

- [x] Initial reference list exists
- [ ] Convert all placeholder numbers to full formatted citations
- [ ] Ensure consistency in citation style across chapters
- [ ] Remove duplicate entries if bibliography is shared

---

## 🧽 Final Cleanup

- [ ] Update all cross-references and figure/table numbers
- [ ] Check for consistency of symbols, fonts, and abbreviations
- [ ] Spell check, grammar, formatting pass
- [ ] LaTeX compile check for PDF output
- [ ] Submit to advisor for review
- [ ] Upload to ProQuest / institutional repository when approved
